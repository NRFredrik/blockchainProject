> CS 481 Term Project Dashboard

FYI: I did this in Vue.js, it's pretty simple to follow but I just had a few hours to get started. I'll get it mostly polished up and finished this week.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
